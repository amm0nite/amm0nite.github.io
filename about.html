    <p>
        Bonjour! I am a french developer with an engineering degree in IT and networks.
        I like programming, sysadmin, DIY connected electronics, gamedev and PC gaming.
        My plan is to use this blog to share my projects and other experiments.
        I want to do cool things and tell people about it.
    </p>
